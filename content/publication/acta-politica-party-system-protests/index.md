abstract: |
  Through a protest event dataset (2002–2022), this study maps how Jobbik and LMP mobilise protest before and after entering parliament. Three mechanisms are identified: issue-profiling, alliance-building, and local presence. Jobbik combines mechanisms, while LMP broadens its issue profile and alliances; both increasingly rely on protest to establish local presence outside Budapest, illustrating how protest feeds party system transformation.
