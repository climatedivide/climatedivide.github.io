abstract: |
  How are conflicts over climate change and Covid-19 embedded in the political space? Do they intensify polarisation along the cultural conflict dimension, or do they cut across the conventional conflict dimensions? This book chapter conceptualises the two issues as “risk conflicts” and analyses them in the context of the long-term restructuring of party competition. It examines both the supply and demand sides of politics using Politbarometer data, the post-election surveys of the German Longitudinal Election Study (GLES), and data on election campaigns from 1976 and from 1994 to 2021. The results confirm the importance of climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic for the 2021 federal election. The long-term restructuring of the political space in Germany follows trends in other Western European countries. Moreover, climate change and Covid-19, as risk conflicts, are anchored - at least up to 2021 - in a two-dimensional space and reinforce polarisation along the cultural dimension.
