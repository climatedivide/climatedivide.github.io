abstract: |
  Research on parties and movements has developed separately, yet “movement parties” blur this divide. This introduction to a special issue reviews definitions and cases, operationalises Kitschelt’s criteria, and assesses movement parties across Europe using new quantitative indicators. The analysis highlights heterogeneity, with few cases matching the full movement-party profile.
