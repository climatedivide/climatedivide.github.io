abstract: |
  The rise of radical right parties triggers varied strategic responses from mainstream parties (MSPs). Using propensity-to-vote data in eight Western European countries, this study estimates how electoral overlap with radical right parties affects MSP positions on immigration. Greater threat of losing voters to the radical right is associated with shifts toward more restrictive immigration policies, while opportunities to win voters back have no significant impact.
