abstract: |
  Using the PolDem protest event dataset for 27 European countries (2000–2021), this study charts the frequency, profile, and drivers of environmental protest. It highlights 2019 as pivotal, with peak participation and salience. Typical events are well-attended, symbolic, and confrontational, drawing on professional and non-professional organisations. Temporal variation in protest counts relates to environmental field resources, while participation levels correlate with political opportunities, creating an “explosive mix” when both align.
