Endre Borbáth is Junior Professor for Empirical-Analytical Participation Research at the Institute of Political Science at Ruprecht-Karls-Universität Heidelberg. He leads the Emmy Noether Research Group “The New Climate Divide” and is a guest researcher at the Center for Civil Society Research at the WZB Berlin Social Science Center.

His research examines mass mobilization amid changing European cleavage structures, shaped by the growing salience of climate change, immigration, and European integration. Bridging comparative politics and political sociology, he analyzes both the supply side (party competition and movement mobilization) and the demand side (individual-level participation, group identities, and political behavior). Methodologically, he primarily employs quantitative approaches, working with data from media coverage of electoral and protest politics as well as individual-level surveys and survey experiments. Geographically, his work focuses on Western, Central, and Eastern Europe.
