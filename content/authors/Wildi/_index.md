Dr. Dino Noah Wildi is a postdoctoral researcher in the research group “The New Climate Divide”, lead by Jun.-Prof. Dr. Endre Borbáth. Within this project, he researches the increasing salience and politicization of climate change in European democracies. His further research focuses on the impact the populist radical right has had on European party systems, in particular on the ways in which mainstream parties have engaged with new challengers, and party strategy in shifting party systems more broadly.

Methodologically, he focuses on quantitative methods, working with data from large election studies and with text data from media coverage and party communications. In particular, he is interested in computational social science methods and the opportunities offered by new technologies such as large language models (LLMs).
