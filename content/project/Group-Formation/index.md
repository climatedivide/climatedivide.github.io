This work package explores how political identities form around the climate divide. It asks how people come to see themselves and others as belonging to opposing camps on climate change, and how these boundaries are shaped by mobilisation, participation, and crisis experiences. The theoretical focus lies on the emergence of in-group and out-group identities and on the role of economic pressures and geopolitical uncertainty in strengthening political divisions related to climate change.

Empirically, this work package relies on qualitative research methods, including focus groups and in-depth interviews with participants and organisational actors involved in climate-related mobilisation. Cases are selected to capture variation in political context and mobilisation intensity. Qualitative analysis is used to reconstruct identity narratives, perceptions of allies and opponents, and the meanings people attach to climate conflict. This work package provides detailed insights that complement the large-scale quantitative evidence generated in the other parts of the project.
