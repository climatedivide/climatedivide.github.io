This work package examines who mobilises around climate change and how mobilisation takes place. It asks which coalitions of political parties, social movements, and civil society organisations engage on the emerging climate divide, and how they frame climate change as a political conflict. The theoretical starting point is that climate change is no longer a consensual issue but an increasingly polarised one, structured by competing interpretations of costs, responsibilities, and solutions. Mobilisation strategies are therefore central to understanding how climate conflict develops and how political divisions deepen or shift over time.

Empirically, this work package applies a computational social science and text-as-data approach to large-scale newspaper coverage of climate-related mobilisation. A manually annotated dataset is used to train and evaluate automated text analysis models that identify actors, issues, frames, and action forms. This approach allows the project to analyse mobilisation patterns systematically across countries and over time. The resulting data are used to map coalitions of actors and to trace how repertoires of contention evolve in response to changing political and economic contexts.
