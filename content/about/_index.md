<div class="about-text">

The **New Climate Divide (ClimateDivide)** project, financed by the **DFG Emmy Noether Programme**, examines how climate change is shifting from a largely valence issue into a positional, cleavage-forming conflict with the potential to restructure political competition and collective identities in Europe. The project argues that polarisation is fuelled both by the consolidation of a regressive, often radical-right front contesting climate reforms and by the mainstreaming, and fragmentation of a progressive “green field.” It conceptualises climate politics as a *distributive conflict* in a geopolitically charged polycrisis context, where relative winners and losers are mobilised through competing frames over (1) problem definition (acknowledgement vs. scepticism), (2) the scope of intervention (market-based fixes vs. broader climate-justice transformation), and (3) the pace of reform (gradual adaptation vs. fast intervention). <br>

Empirically, ClimateDivide maps and explains this emerging cleavage across both electoral and civil-society arenas in seven European countries (France, Germany, Sweden, Italy, Spain, Hungary, Romania) over 2010–2030. It combines **computational social science** and “text-as-data” approaches, drawing on media data, with **surveys and survey experiments**, implemented in the context of an original panel data, and **qualitative focus groups** with both organisations and participants on the progressive and the regressive sides of the divide. This mixed-methods design enables systematic comparisons of coalitions’ repertoires of contention, individual-level participation (depth, breadth, and action form), and the dynamics of in- and out-group identity formation.
